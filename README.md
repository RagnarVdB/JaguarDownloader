# Yt_download
This is a gui for the cli downloader tool youtube-dl. The gui is a flask web app, running locally using [flaskwebgui](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui). The front-end is made with Vue.js.
Please note that I am new to vue an Flask and this project is more about the learning experience than about its usefulness. I am currently still building on the first version of the project. Any feedback is always appreciated.
